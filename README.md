# Asar
Originally written by **Alcaro**. Based on version v1.50 (fixes by RPG Hacker, Raidenthequick, p4plus2).

This repository provides just the minimal modifications to easily build the program on Unix systems.

### Instructions
You will need a working C++ compiler (g++ or clang++) and SCons.
```
# Build the program:
scons

# Discover how to use it:
./asar --help
```
That's it!
